## About The Project

![Screen Shot](down1.png)
![Screen Shot](down2.png)

The project's motivation was to predict the returns of around 2000 stocks. This experiment was performed on the realtime that was provided by the stock exchange company Japan Exchange Group.  I designed an end-to-end data science modelling pipepline, starting from data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering to predictive modelling all combined in a jupyter notebook for ease of use. 

Firstly, I did extensive data cleaning and visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and NumPy. I created a lot of count plots, point plots, and other graphs.

Secondly, I did some Feature Engineering using library called TA. The features were generated synthetically using all the 42 indicators based on volume, votality, trend, momentum etc. These features helped in increasing the accuracy of the model.

Thirdly, LightGBM model was trained using the generated features with minimal error.

Lastly, Data Visualizations were drawn for analysis.
