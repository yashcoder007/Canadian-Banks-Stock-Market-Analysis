## About The Project

![Screen Shot](T.png)


The project's motivation was to future forecast the average stock prices of TD, Scotia and RBC bank. Time series analysis is done using the state of the art SARIMA and XGBoost. Three months of future forecasting is done using regression models. 

Firstly, I did extensive data cleaning and visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and NumPy. I created a lot of count plots, point plots, and other graphs.

Secondly, I did some Feature Engineering and Manual Hyperparameter tuning. These features helped in increasing the accuracy of the model.

Thirdly, the SARIMA and XGBoost Regressor were trained on the time series data and prediction. The models performed at a mean squared error of less than 1.5 %.

Lastly, Data Visualizations was done.
